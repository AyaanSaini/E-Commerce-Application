                <p>Tamba, which is also called tehmat is the 
                  Punjabi version of the lungi which has folds 
                  at the front and is the traditional dress for 
                  Punjabi men. The tamba is worn by Bhangra dancers.
                  <br/><br/>
                  laacha differs from the tehmat in that it has a border 
                  and is variegated so that it has more than one colour.
                  The laacha is worn in a like manner to the tehmat except 
                  it has more folds. 
                  <br/><br/>
                  The Punjabi kurta is made of two rectangular pieces with 
                  side slits, and a front opening below the neck. 
                  In the past, it was traditional for men to wear a gold 
                  or silver chain (zanjiri) woven around the buttons.
